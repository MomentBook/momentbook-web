## MomentBook — Product Definition (Read First)

This document defines **what MomentBook is** and **what it is not**.

All discussions, suggestions, designs, and implementations  
must align with this document before any other context.

---

## 1. What MomentBook Is

MomentBook is a **quiet travel and daily movement journal**.

It helps a day be remembered  
**without asking the user to consciously record it**.

The app assumes:

-   life happens first
-   recording should be optional
-   memory can be shaped gently, after the day ends

MomentBook stays out of the user’s way.

---

## 2. The Assumed User

The user is **not** someone trying to journal.

The user is:

> “A person living their day — not someone trying to 기록 something.”

They may:

-   move through places
-   take photos naturally (often outside the app)
-   forget to open the app for hours

MomentBook does not punish, remind, or correct this behavior.

---

## 3. What MomentBook Is Not

MomentBook is **not**:

-   a writing-first app
-   a habit tracker
-   a productivity tool
-   a social network
-   a memory “tracking” app
-   a feature-driven product

It does **not**:

-   encourage streaks
-   push daily engagement
-   reward consistency
-   promote performance or comparison

If an idea resembles any of the above, it is likely wrong.

---

## 4. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These principles override features, UI, and technical convenience.

-   No forcing — only optional
-   No commands — only gentle invitations
-   State-first experience, not screen-first
-   Less interaction is better than more interaction
-   No SNS logic or engagement thinking

When uncertain, **remove instead of adding**.

---

## 5. The Experience, Conceptually

MomentBook is designed around a **day**, not around actions.

Conceptual flow (not a UI checklist):

-   The user lives their day
-   Photos are taken naturally
-   Movement happens quietly
-   The app remembers passively
-   At the end of the day, the app organizes everything
-   One recap gently closes the day as a single memory

This recap is:

-   automatic
-   optional
-   a closing ritual, not a task

---

## 6. Privacy & Sharing Philosophy

MomentBook is **private by default**.

-   Records are personal first.
-   Nothing is shared automatically.
-   Sharing is always **optional**, never required.

If sharing exists:

-   It shares **the result**, not the full process.
-   It happens after the day is complete, not during it.
-   It does not turn memory into performance.

Sharing does **not** create:

-   a social graph
-   a feed
-   likes, comments, or reactions
-   engagement metrics

Memory is something to be held first.

---

## 6-1. Data Usage & Future Monetization Clarity

MomentBook’s philosophy is privacy-first, not data-denial.

The app processes certain user data
(such as photos, location, and movement context)
in order to quietly organize a day into a single memory.

This data processing exists to support the experience —
not to observe, profile, or optimize the user.

At the current stage:

-   The app does not run advertisements
-   The app does not sell user data
-   The app does not track users for advertising or cross-service profiling

However, MomentBook does not make absolute promises about never using data beyond today.

In the future:

-   Optional monetization features (including advertising) may be introduced
-   Any use of behavioral or usage data beyond core functionality must:
    -   be explicitly disclosed
    -   require clear, opt-in user consent
    -   be reflected in updated Terms and Privacy Policy

Public-facing language must never claim that
MomentBook “never tracks users” or “never uses data for ads.”

The philosophy is quiet respect — not irreversible guarantees.

---

## 7. Storage & Ownership

MomentBook treats memory as something personal.

-   Records belong to the user first.
-   Storage decisions must preserve:
    -   privacy
    -   ownership
    -   non-obligation

Whether stored locally or backed up elsewhere,  
the default posture remains quiet and personal.

---

## 8. Who This App Fits

MomentBook fits:

-   days with movement
-   days with photos taken naturally
-   days that deserve a quiet ending
-   people who dislike being told to “record” their life

MomentBook may **not** fit:

-   people seeking productivity or habit enforcement
-   people wanting public sharing or feedback
-   people who expect constant interaction or rewards

This is intentional.

---

## 9. The Emotional Outcome

When a day ends, the intended feeling is:

> “Today has been closed as one memory.”

Not:

-   achievement
-   progress
-   success
-   completion

Just closure.

---

## 10. Final Principle

MomentBook is not an app that avoids sharing.

It is an app that does **not depend on sharing**.

The day belongs to the user first.
