## MomentBook — Product Definition (Read First)

This document defines **what MomentBook is** and **what it is not**.

All discussions, suggestions, designs, and implementations  
must align with this document before any other context.

---

## 1. What MomentBook Is

MomentBook is a **quiet travel and daily movement journal**.

It helps a day be remembered  
**without asking the user to consciously record it**.

MomentBook assumes that:

-   life happens first
-   recording should be optional
-   memory can be shaped gently, after the day ends

The app stays out of the user’s way.

---

## 2. The Assumed User

The user is **not** someone trying to journal.

The user is:

> “A person living their day — not someone trying to 기록 something.”

They may:

-   move through places
-   take photos naturally (often outside the app)
-   forget to open the app for hours

MomentBook does not punish, remind, or correct this behavior.

---

## 3. What MomentBook Is Not

MomentBook is **not**:

-   a writing-first app
-   a habit tracker
-   a productivity tool
-   a social network
-   a memory “tracking” app
-   a feature-driven product

It does **not**:

-   encourage streaks
-   push daily engagement
-   reward consistency
-   promote sharing
-   turn memory into performance

If an idea resembles any of the above, it is likely wrong.

---

## 4. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These principles override features, UI, and technical convenience.

-   No forcing — only optional
-   No commands — only gentle invitations
-   State-first experience, not screen-first
-   Less interaction is better than more interaction
-   No SNS logic, no engagement thinking

When uncertain, **remove instead of adding**.

---

## 5. The Experience, Conceptually

MomentBook is designed around a **day**, not around actions.

Conceptual flow (not a UI checklist):

-   The user lives their day
-   Photos are taken naturally
-   Movement happens quietly
-   The app remembers passively
-   At the end of the day, the app organizes everything
-   One recap gently closes the day as a single memory

This recap is:

-   automatic
-   optional
-   a closing ritual, not a task

---

## 6. Privacy & Storage Philosophy

MomentBook is **private by default**.

-   Records are personal
-   No social graph
-   No public feed
-   No engagement metrics

Memory is treated as something to be held, not published.

---

## 7. Who This App Fits

MomentBook fits:

-   days with movement
-   days with photos taken naturally
-   days that deserve a quiet ending
-   people who dislike being told to “record” their life

MomentBook may **not** fit:

-   people seeking productivity or habit enforcement
-   people wanting public sharing or feedback
-   people who want detailed manual logging

This is intentional.

---

## 8. The Emotional Outcome

When a day ends, the intended feeling is:

> “Today has been closed as one memory.”

Not:

-   achievement
-   progress
-   success
-   completion

Just closure.

---

## 9. Final Rule

MomentBook is not something to be optimized.

It is something a user may quietly recognize — or not.

The product must respect both outcomes.
