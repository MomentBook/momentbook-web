1. Project Purpose

This project is the public-facing web and SEO site for the MomentBook app.

Its purpose is to:

Explain what MomentBook is — calmly and accurately

Help the right users discover the app via search

Set expectations before app installation

Guide users to the native app (App Store / Google Play)

This project does not implement or extend product behavior.

MomentBook’s actual experience lives entirely in the native app.

2. Relationship to the Native App (Source of Truth)

The native MomentBook app is the primary product

This web project is descriptive, not prescriptive

All UX, state logic, and emotional outcomes are defined in the app project

If there is uncertainty about:

wording

feature interpretation

user expectations

👉 Defer to the app’s Project Context & AI Alignment Guide

The web must never redefine or reinterpret the product.

3. What This Web Project SHOULD Do

Explain the product’s philosophy before its features

Communicate who the app is for — and who it is not for

Describe the experience at a conceptual level, not operational

Prioritize clarity, calmness, and trust over persuasion

Be SEO-friendly without becoming marketing-heavy

This site exists to help users recognize themselves, not to convince them.

4. What This Web Project MUST NOT Do

The web must NOT:

Invent features not present in the app

Describe internal app states as user-visible mechanics

Promise future functionality or roadmaps

Use productivity, habit, or performance framing

Encourage sharing, publishing, or social interaction

Turn the app into a “tool” rather than an experience

If something feels like a pitch, it is likely wrong.

5. Language & Tone Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All copy must follow these principles:

Calm, quiet, and human

Observational, not directive

Invitational, not persuasive

Reflective, not energetic

Allowed

“You might find this useful if…”

“This app quietly remembers your day”

“Nothing is required”

Forbidden

“Track your life”

“Build a habit”

“Never forget again”

“Stay consistent”

“Capture everything”

When in doubt, say less.

6. SEO Philosophy

SEO is a discovery mechanism, not a persuasion tool.

Pages should answer honest questions people may search for

Keywords must not distort product meaning

Titles/descriptions should be factual, not optimized hype

Avoid clickbait phrasing or exaggerated promises

SEO pages must reflect reality, not aspiration.

7. Technical Principles

Built with Next.js (App Router)

Prefer static generation (SSG / ISR)

Metadata is first-class (SEO, Open Graph, canonical)

Accessibility and performance are mandatory

Keep dependencies minimal

This site should be simple, fast, and long-lived.

8. AI Usage Rules

When assisting this project, AI must:

Respect the native app’s philosophy

Avoid suggesting new product directions

Avoid translating app internals into web flows

Prefer omission over elaboration

Ask before introducing new sections or narratives

If uncertain, default to explaining less, not more.

9. Final Principle

MomentBook is not something to be sold.

It is something a user either quietly recognizes — or does not.

The web should respect that choice.
